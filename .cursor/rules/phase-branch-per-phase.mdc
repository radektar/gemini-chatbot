# Phase Branch Per Phase

When starting a **new phase** of implementation (according to "Implementation Plan (Phases)" section in `@docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`):

- Always work on a **new branch** named according to the convention: `phase/<NN>-<slug>`.
  - Examples: `phase/01-auth-gating`, `phase/02-postgres-history`, `phase/03-integrations-readonly`.
- Before starting implementation, ensure that:
  - the phase has met **entry criteria**,
  - and planned changes fulfill **exit criteria / Definition of Done** for that phase.
- If a branch for the phase already exists, use the existing one instead of creating a duplicate.

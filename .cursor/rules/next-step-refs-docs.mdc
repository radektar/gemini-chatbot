# Next Step References Documentation

If the user asks about **next step / what's next / next step / what now**:

- First check and base your answer on: `@docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `@docs/BACKLOG.md`, `@CHANGELOG.md`.
- Propose a specific next step as a **backlog task** (ID in format `PHxx-...`), consistent with dependencies and entry/exit criteria of phases.
- Mention which **version** from `@CHANGELOG.md` this is related to (e.g., "consistent with plan from [0.1.2]" or "next step after [0.1.2]").
- If documents don't provide a clear answer, ask 1–3 clarifying questions instead of guessing.

## Model Providers

This template ships with Anthropic Claude models as the default. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Google Gemini](https://ai.google.dev), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fimpact-chad&env=AUTH_SECRET,ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&envDescription=Learn%20more%20about%20how%20to%20get%20the%20API%20Keys%20for%20the%20application&envLink=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel-labs%2Fimpact-chad%2Fblob%2Fmain%2F.env.example&demo-title=Impact%20Chad&demo-description=An%20AI-powered%20chatbot%20with%20Monday.com%20and%20Slack%20integrations,%20built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fimpact-chad.vercel.ai&stores=[{%22type%22:%22postgres%22},{%22type%22:%22blob%22}])

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various Google Cloud and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
